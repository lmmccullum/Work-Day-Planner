                                   WORK DAY PLANNER

DESCRIPTION:

Yay! I've created my first Work-Day Planner for a hard working employee or just a person with a busy schedule that needs to add important events to a daily planner. This allows a particular user to manage their time effectively. This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript/Jquery code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To create a schedule, open the Daily Planner
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
Scroll down, the user will be presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm)
The user will notice color-coded time blocks for that day which indicates whether it is in the past, present, or future
Click desired time block and enter an event, then SAVE
That event will be saved in local storage
When the page is refreshed the saved events persist
